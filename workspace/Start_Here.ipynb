    "\n",
    "End-to-End NLP material is designed from a real-world perspective that follows Data processing, development, and deployment pipeline paradigm. The material consist of three labs and the goal is to walk you through the a single flow of raw text `data preprocessing` and how to build a SQuAD dataset format for Question Answering, train the dataset via `NVIDIA TAO` transfer learning BERT model, and deploy using `RIVA`. Furthermore, a challenge notebook is introduced to test your understanding of the material and solidify your experience in the Question Answering (QA) domain.\n",

    "- enables bootcamp attendees to solve real-world problem using end-to-end approach (data processing --> development --> deployment)\n"
