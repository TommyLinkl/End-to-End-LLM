    "The SQuAD dataset is in `json` format and contains the `version` of the json file and `data`. Within the `data` is the `title` and `paragraphs`. Within the `paragraphs` lies the `qas` and `context`. Details on `qas` and `context` have been discussed in our previous notebook on `overview of QA dataset`. A context is a text extracted from a document. It is advisable that number of questions and answers `(qa)` on a single context should not exceed 10 in order to have good training result. More so, each question should have a unique id, and those with no corresponding answers (whose answers could difficult to drawn from the context) should have the `is_impossible` flag set to `True` and have `plausible_answers`. The extract from SQuAD 2.0 dataset below shows the first title `Beyonce` and the last title `matter` to aid your understanding of of SQuAD 2.0 json format. The simplified structural overview is presented in figure 1.\n",

Question and answer extraction from text are based on personal understanding of the text and the intuition of questionable and answerable context from the text. For example, if a text file is given to group of persons, the questions and answers each individual would drawn from the text may slightly differ based on either their understanding of the text or facts they could deduce or spot from the text. During the process of QA extraction, the questions & answers, and the context where they are manually extracted within the text can be formatted in SQuAD format by following the steps below.  \n",

    "- **Step 3**: In Sheet 1, create three columns namely `tid` (title id), `cid` (context id), and context. This implies that each context is drawn from a particular topic `(title)` denoted by `tid` and has its own unique id as `cid`.\n",
    "- **Step 4**: In Sheet 2, create four columns namely `tid` (title id), `cid` (context id), question, and answer. Each question and answer are drawn from a context in Sheet1 represented by `cid` (context id) and `tid` (title from which the context was extracted). In a case where the question has no answer that could be drawn from a context then, the answer column is left blank, or `“no-answer”` phrase is written there.\n",

    "Automatic question answering generation AQAG is based on the use of transformer models to generate questions and answers from a given text. A project on AQAG by `Patil Suraj` is found at `https://github.com/patil-suraj/question_generation`. The project is an open source based on seq-2-seq pre-trained transformer models using a straight-forward end-to-end methods. `SQuAD dataset` and `T5 model` were used to develop the project with varying input processing format. For more information, please visit [patil-suraj/question_generation on Github](https://github.com/patil-suraj/question_generation). The project includes four approaches namely: answer aware question generation, answer extraction models (AQ), multi-task question answer-question generation (Multitask QA-QG), and end-to-end question generation (answer agnostic). Examples on how to use question generation using transformers by Patil Suraj is given as follows:\n",
